Data scientist and nuclear physicist finishing a PhD on uncertainty quantification for neutron spectrum measurement. Love building stuff, testing stuff and analysing stuff (mostly in python)

Curretnly affiliated with the University of Birmingham and UK Atomic Energy Authority

Have a poke around and please get in touch if you would like to use anything without an open source licence (usually fine!)

Currently working on:
- nFoils: Python package for Bayesian neutron spectrum measurement using activation foils
- preprocessing and postprocessing scripts for the neutronics codes FISPACT, MCNP, OpenMC
